# Project Started with Create Next App
This project was bootstrapped with Create Next App.

# Project Introduction
This project was created for the application to a job in Vizir Software Studio, created in the date 29/03/21 in the local repo and pushed to git in 30/03. The main programming language used was JavaScript in the form of JSX and HTML/CSS.

The project assignment was to create a web player to create a .

The approach used was: Bring data from a fictitious API that provides a JSON data that is treated and formatted and passed through the component tree from top-down, and when data is needed to be shared along with the components in the same level, the Context API is used. Most of the types were superset with Typescript to ensure a cleaner code maintenance.


# Project Goal
This project was created for an immersion provided by Rocketseat into the Next Level Week 5

# Code Splitting
The code splitting pattern in this project was the one recommended by Next, splitting the code into components, in place of a monolithic approach, granting them isolation between each other. As so, every instance of code, including the business logic for player component, the way that the data is shared between the components is by using the native React Context API that allows that sibling-sibling communication.

# Used dependencies
The dependencies used in the SPA are located in the package.json file, and the main ones other than the ones brought by create-next-app were: server-json, axios, SASS, NEXT.JS and date-fns.

# How to run The SPA
The command npm run dev runs the app in the development mode.
